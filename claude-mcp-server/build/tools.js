                    description: `The HTTPQL query to filter requests. HTTPQL is the query language we use in Caido to let you filtering requests and responses.
req: HTTP requests.
resp: HTTP responses.
row: A table row.

req:
ext: The file extension (if present). Extensions in Caido always contain the leading . (such as .js).
host: The hostname of the target server.
method: The HTTP Method used for the request in uppercase. If the request is malformed, this will contain the bytes read until the first whitespace.
path: The path of the query, including the extension.
port: The port of the target server.
raw: The full raw data of the request. This allows you to search by elements that Caido currently does not index (such as headers).
created_at: The date and time the request was sent.

resp:
code: The status code of the response. If the response is malformed, this will contain everything after HTTP/1.1 and the following whitespace.
raw: The full raw data of the response. This allows you to search by elements that Caido currently does not index (such as headers).
roundtrip: The total time taken (in milliseconds) for the request to travel from the client to the server and for the response to travel back from the server to the client.

row
id: The numerical ID of a table row.


Operator and Value
The Value types and associated Operators that Caido supports include:

Integers
These Operators work on Fields that are numerical (port, code, roundtrip and id).

eq: Equal to the supplied value.
gt: Greater than the supplied value.
gte: Greater than or equal to the supplied value.
lt: Less than the supplied value.
lte: Less than or equal to the supplied value.
ne: Not equal to the supplied value.
String/Bytes
These Operators work on Fields that are text or byte values (ext, host, method, path, query and raw).

cont: Contains the supplied value.
eq: Equal to the supplied value.
like: The SQLite LIKE Operator.
ncont: Does not contain the supplied value.
ne: Not equal to the supplied value.
nlike: The SQLite NOT LIKE Operator.
TIPS

The cont and ncont Operators are case insensitive.
In SQLite - the % character matches zero or more characters (such as %.js to match .map.js) and the _ character matches one character (such as v_lue to match vAlue).
The like Operator is case sensitive for unicode characters that are beyond the ASCII range.

Regex
These Operators work on Fields that are text or byte values (that are text or byte values (ext, host, method, path, query and raw_).

regex: Matches the regex /value.+/.
nregex: Doesn't match the regex /value.+/.

INFO

Not all regex features are currently supported by Caido (such as look-ahead expressions) as they are not included in the regex library of Rust.

Logical Operators
Caido offers two Logical Operators:

AND: Both the left and right clauses must be true.
OR: Either the left or right clause must be true.


Date/Time
These Operators work on the created_at Field.

gt: Greater than the supplied value.
lt: Less than the supplied value.
The supported time formats for the values used with created_at Operators are:

RFC3339 - example: 2024-06-24T17:03:48+00:00
ISO 8601 - example: 2024-06-24T17:03:48+0000
RFC2822 - example: Mon, 24 Jun 2024 17:03:48 +0000
RFC7231 - example: Mon, 24 Jun 2024 17:03:48 GMT
ISO9075 - example: 2024-06-24T17:03:48Z


Example:
(req.host.eq:"example.com" AND req.path.cont:"/api/") OR (req.created_at.gt:"2024-06-24T17:03:48+00:00")
